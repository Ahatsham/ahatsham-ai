            <p>
                I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering with a passion for advancing research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My work focuses on developing large language models to better understand and predict human behavior using longitudinal data. Combining strong technical expertise with a dedication to innovative problem-solving, I aim to contribute meaningful solutions in AI-driven data analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond research, I am committed to sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration within the community. I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and human experience, always striving to push the boundaries of what intelligent systems can achieve. You can reach me at

            <h2>Research Focus</h2>
            <p>
                My research centers on leveraging advanced language models and multimodal machine learning techniques to analyze longitudinal experiential data. Specifically, I work on developing large language models to predict behavioral and emotional engagement, science identity, and confidence levels over time. By integrating temporal patterns and multimodal inputs, my work aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of AI-driven forecasting models in educational and human-centered contexts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I investigate robust methods for handling missing data, domain adaptation, and cross-distribution evaluation to ensure that models remain reliable across diverse populations and changing conditions. Ultimately, my goal is to build AI systems that provide actionable insights and support personalized learning and development.

            <h2>Human-First AI Lab (HAL 2.0)</h2>
            <p>
                I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Human-First Artificial Intelligence Lab (HAL 2.0), led by <a href="https://mrhasan-ai.github.io/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. M.R. Hasan</a>, where we are dedicated to pioneering AI technologies that prioritize human values, ethical integrity, and societal benefit. Drawing inspiration from the iconic 1968 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>, our lab’s name pays homage to HAL 9000—the film’s AI that serves as a cautionary tale of misalignment—while HAL 2.0 represents a new vision: developing AI that seamlessly aligns with human goals and enhances real-world impact. From transforming education and healthcare to fostering inclusive, trustworthy innovations, our research is shaping AI as a force for social good.
