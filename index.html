            <!-- Your intro paragraph: One paragraph with links -->
            I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering with a passion for advancing research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My work focuses on developing and fine-tuning language models to better understand and predict human behavior using longitudinal data. Combining strong technical expertise with a dedication to innovative problem-solving, I aim to contribute meaningful solutions in AI-driven data analysis.

Beyond research, I am committed to sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration within the community. I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and human experience, always striving to push the boundaries of what intelligent systems can achieve.
