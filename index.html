            <!-- Your intro paragraph: One paragraph with links -->
            I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering with a passion for advancing research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My work focuses on developing and fine-tuning language models to better understand and predict human behavior using longitudinal data. Combining strong technical expertise with a dedication to innovative problem-solving, I aim to contribute meaningful solutions in AI-driven data analysis.
            
            Beyond research, I am committed to sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration within the community. I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and human experience, always striving to push the boundaries of what intelligent systems can achieve.

            My research centers on leveraging advanced language models and multimodal machine learning techniques to analyze longitudinal experiential data. Specifically, I work on developing large language models to predict behavioral and emotional engagement, science identity, and confidence levels over time. By integrating temporal patterns and multimodal inputs, my work aims to improve the accuracy and interpretability of AI-driven forecasting models in educational and human-centered contexts.

            Additionally, I investigate robust methods for handling missing data, domain adaptation, and cross-distribution evaluation to ensure that models remain reliable across diverse populations and changing conditions. Ultimately, my goal is to build AI systems that provide actionable insights and support personalized learning and development.
