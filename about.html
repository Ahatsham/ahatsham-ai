                            From a family where education and research are the cornerstones of life, with my father dedicating his career to teaching at a polytechnic in India and my elder brother inspiring minds as a lecturer at the University of Brighton in the UK, my path in research felt almost predestined. It all started with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from UTU, igniting a spark that led me to pursue a Master's in CSE from VNIT in India. Eager to share knowledge, I began as an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Parul University, then at the University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, both in India, where I discovered the joy of mentoring young talents.

                            Yearning for deeper exploration, I ventured to Portugal as a researcher at LARSYS, delving into innovative projects. Today, as a Graduate Research Assistant in the ECE department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), my drive stems from a profound curiosity: to decode the intricacies of the human brain and engineer systems that emulate its remarkable capabilities, bridging the gap between biology and technology.

                    Yet, life isn't confined to labs and lectures; my true passion ignites in the untamed wilderness, where the call of the mountains echoes my deepest dreams. Aspiring to one day stand atop Mount Everest, conquering its formidable heights, I thrive on outdoor adventures, though hiking and climbing hold a special place in my soul. When the office doors close, the trails open, pulling me into nature's embrace across continentsâ€”from the rugged terrains of India and Europe to the vast expanses of North America. But it's Nepal that captures my heart eternally, with unforgettable vistas from Everest and Annapurna base camps, where the sheer majesty of snow-capped giants and fluttering prayer flags remind me of life's boundless possibilities. Here in the USA, I've triumphantly summited 8 of Colorado's 58 majestic 14ers, each ascent a step closer to my goals, fueling my spirit for the long, exhilarating journey ahead.
